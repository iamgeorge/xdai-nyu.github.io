## Course Rationale

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into many walks of life, and AI learning is deemed a 21st century skill with applications in several professional careers, including education. AI algorithms have also found applications in learning environments, for personalizing learning content, scaffolding, and learning analytics, and it is imperative for professionals in learning ecosystems to gain conceptual and practical AI knowledge, as well as participate in creating AI tools. To prepare students for a future workforce, and enable them to be responsible creators of emerging technology, this course engages students in gaining basic AI competency, discuss key topics in AI in relevance to applications in learning, and reflect on the ethical implications of integrating AI in our learning environments, while simultaneously building AI tools to enhance learning. This course goes over essential literature in AI for learning, and societal and ethical implications of AI, and engages students in designing human-centered AI solutions to scaffold learning. 

## Course Description

This course will be going over the fundamentals of designing AI systems, the nuts and bolts of machine learning algorithms, designing learning technology with AI, and discussing the societal and ethical implications of AI on learning environments. Students will explore, study and critique current work in using AI systems in learning environments. Students will also engage in seminal work around AI for learning, and societal and ethical implications of AI. They will gain practical experience in using AI tools, and creating their own. They will engage in group work around designing AI-powered systems for scaffolding learning, while reflecting on the long-term implications of the system. This project-based course is meant to be an introduction to Artificial Intelligence systems and tools, particularly for learning applications. Key topics include: artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network architectures, human-AI interaction, creative ML, large language models, and AI in learning. Students are expected to complete this course with (1) a functional AI-powered tool, or an implementable framework for using AI in learning, and (2) a paper describing the design of your project. There are no prerequisites to this course, but students will be asked to use certain Python libraries, hence, basic familiarity with, or eagerness to learn about programming, is preferred. 

This course has five key elements: (1) Fundamentals of AI, (2) Designing Human-centered AI (3) AI in learning environments, (4) Prototyping learning tools with AI, and (5) Societal and ethical implications of AI systems, that are intertwined across 14 class sessions.
