How does the AI work? Students learn about what different terms such as big data, machine learning, deeplearning, reinforcement and artificial intelligence mean, and how they relate with one another. We then explore datasets, such as the imagenet and LAION-5B to gain a sense of datasets used for training AI. Through an interactive simulation, students learn about how the feedforward and backpropagation processes in Neural Networks work.We dive deeper into Recurrent Neural Networks and their applications in Natural Language Processing. 

## In class activity
Students play the contours to classification game, where students act as nodes in a neural network, and participate in a feedforward and backpropagation process to simulate an Artificial Neural Network. Students also use transfer learning in Teachable Machines to train their own classification algorithm. Students are then asked to reflect how they could use a tool such as Teachable Machines in their teaching/learning process.
