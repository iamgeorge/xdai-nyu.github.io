title: Technology in Learning 
week: 4
date: 2025-02-11
---

In a flipped classroom style, we discuss historic case studies of instructional technology, and studentsâ€™ lived experiences of their long-term impact. What changed with calculators in the classroom? With computers? With AI? We will discuss scaffolding using AI chatbots, and early findings from research pieces discussing personalized scaffolding. 


## Week 4 Readings

How have new technologies transformed educational spaces and pedagogies in the past? Choose a technology (i.e., radio, television, computers, or the internet) and read about its reported impact on classrooms and teacher pedagogy across all assigned readings.

## Project Pitches 
Revise your project pitches for next week's class. This is to gauge early interests. We will use these project pitchs to form groups for your final projects. Make sure your slides are in the group drive.
