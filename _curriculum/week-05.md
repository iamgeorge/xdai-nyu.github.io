title: Technology in Learning 
week: 5
date: 2025-02-18
---

In a flipped classroom style, we discuss historic case studies of instructional technology, and studentsâ€™ lived experiences of their long-term impact. What changed with calculators in the classroom? With computers? With AI? We will discuss scaffolding using AI chatbots, and early findings from research pieces discussing personalized scaffolding.

## In-class Activity
 Students will interact with a co-writing tool scaffolding different writing styles and vocabulary development in storytelling. Students will reflect on ownership in a co-created human-AI artifact. 

## Week 5 Readings

1. Self-study: Technology has transformed educational spaces and pedagogies in the past. Choose a technology (i.e., radio, television, computers, or the internet) and research (use any sources: internet, magazines, movies, etc.) its reported impact on classrooms and teacher pedagogy.
2. [A History of Instructional Design and Technology: Part I: A History of Instructional Media, Robert A, Reiser, 2001](https://docdrop.org/static/drop-pdf/A-history-of-instructional-design-and-technology-1-8nOHG.pdf)
3. [Technology and School Reform: A View from Both Sides of the Tracks, Mark Warschauer, 2000](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Myr49eNCnkLDnCTdr_sbOnL61CzTVXs3/view?usp=sharing)

## Project Update 2
Meet with your teams to decide on your problem statement. Teams will write the first draft of their problem statement, including:
1. Outline their target learning audience
2. An identified learning need (with references, or personal experiences) 
3. A rationale for how you imagine AI may assist this learning need
4. Footnote: Contribution of each group member (this footnote need to be a short line after each group submission)

**Project Update Submission [GROUP]: [Project Update 1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hbx0OF1QKc88oBTR3nn64RTYAzKkrHsr?usp=sharing)** *(due on 02/17, 5:00 PM EST)* -->


<!-- ## Project Update 3
Students will conduct a literature review in the use of technology addressing the learning needs they identified. They will write two accounts of projects or papers addressing (or failing to address) those learning needs.
