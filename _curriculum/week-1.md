This introductory class will go over the course syllabus, course expectations, and introduce to students key concepts in designing AI systems. We will cover case studies of AI in learning systems, such as, the use of social agents to scaffold learning, and chatbots for scaffolding problem-solving. We will discuss studentsâ€™ early understandings of applications and implications of using AI systems in learning environments. Through seminal works, students will get introduced to basic concepts in AI for learning, such as, personalization, social interaction, adaptive systems, emotion recognition, contextual feedback, and data analytics. 


## In-class Activity
Speculate AI Futures: Working with partners, students will speculate on a futuristic learning environment, and how they would incorporate technology into this system to make it their ideal learning environment, and share with the class. 

## Readings
No readings prior to the introductory class. 

## Take-home Assignment
Code activity (Jupyter Notebook) - Introduction to using AI APIs. Through a guided code notebook, students will be able to use AI APIs to design a learning chatbot (e.g. a history bot that guesses a historical figure or event). This activity will also get students up to speed with Python programming.
