In a flipped classroom style, we discuss historic case studies of instructional technology, and studentsâ€™ lived experiences of their long-term impact. What changed with calculators in the classroom? With computers? With AI? We will discuss scaffolding using AI chatbots, and early findings from research pieces discussing personalized scaffolding.
