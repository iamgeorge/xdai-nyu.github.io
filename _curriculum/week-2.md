We often hear of the human and AI dichotomy, but can they flourish in tandem? Students are introduced to key concepts in human-centered AI (HCAI), and we go over the two-dimensional HCAI framework (Shneiderman, 2022). We discuss the HCAI concepts: user-centered design, transparency, explainability, inclusivity, equity, safety, and regulation. We especially dive deeper into Explainable AI (XAI), and explainability implications for AI systems in learning.
