title: AI in Learning - II
week: 6
date: 2025-02-25
---

Students will explore key concepts in personalized ML algorithms, AI for assistive learning, adaptive systems, AI tutors, social AI companions, educational data mining and learning analytics. We will dive deeper into AI for fostering learning behaviors, such as, curiosity, growth mindset and creativity. 

## In-class Activity
 Students will interact with a co-writing tool scaffolding different writing styles and vocabulary development in storytelling. Students will reflect on ownership in a co-created human-AI artifact.
